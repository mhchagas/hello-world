# hello-world
This is my first repository, where I am supposed to tell something about myself. The idea is that people get to know me.
The readme file provides information about the package under development.

So now that I screwed up my first attempt because I changed the master directly, I deleted the branch and am now repeating the process, this time in the proper manner. This shows how I work, going back and forth trying out things.
